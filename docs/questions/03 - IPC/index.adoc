== Inter-process communication

Inter-process communication (IPC) refers to the mechanisms used by different processes to communicate with each other. Here, we approach this subject within the context of a microservice architecture application. This is important because microservices are typically designed to be independently deployable and scalable, which means they are often deployed on different machines or in different locations.

There is a wide range of IPC mechanisms available, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here, we will focus on the most popular ones, by category.
